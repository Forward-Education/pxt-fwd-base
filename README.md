# The Base Extension

The purpose of this repo is to host dependencies of modules in pxt-fwd-modules. It's easier to manage versioning when you avoid having a module be dependent on something in the same repo. Refer to README.md in pxt-forward-modules for a full breakdown of the Forward Education extension ecosystem.

Nothing in this repo should have blocks. It's all behind the scenes.

## The Servo Situation

Positional and continuous servos must use the same clients. To allow the independent inclusion of positional and continuous servo blocks, the servo clients and their functionality are defined in the base and the blocks are provided in pxt-fwd-modules through fwd-servo-continuous and fwd-servo-positional modules.
